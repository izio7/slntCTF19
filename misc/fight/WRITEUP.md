By running the executable file we are faced with a fighting game in which we can choose only one character to fight against a Chuck Norris (apparently) impossible to beat.
It can be beaten by using MUGEN's cheats (`F1`) or by lowering the difficulty in the `data/mugen.cfg` file. Once typed, the `slntCTF{F1n1sh_H1m!}` flag is printed on the screen.
More simply, you can search for the string `slntCTF` recursively in the root directory.
